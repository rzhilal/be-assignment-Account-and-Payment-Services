## **Project Overview**
The Account and Payment Manager Services are two backend services designed to manage users' accounts and transactions. The project includes user registration and authentication, account management, transaction processing, and optional recurring payments. The services are built with Node.js, Fastify, and Prisma ORM, and are containerized using Docker.

## **Tech Stack**
- **Node.js**: Primary platform for building the server.
- **Fastify**: Web framework used for building the APIs.
- **Prisma**: ORM for database interaction.
- **PostgreSQL**: (or MongoDB) Database used to store user accounts, transactions, and payment history.
- **Docker**: Containerization tool to ensure the application runs consistently across environments.
- **Swagger**: API documentation tool.
- **Node-cron**: (Optional) Job scheduler for recurring payments.

## **Architecture**
The application is split into two main services:
1. **Account Manager Service**: Manages user accounts and payment accounts.
2. **Payment Manager Service**: Handles transactions, including send and withdraw operations.

Each service is independently containerized and can be scaled as needed.

## **Setup and Installation**
### **Prerequisites**
- **Node.js**: Ensure Node.js is installed (recommended version: LTS).
- **Docker**: Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.
- **PostgreSQL/MongoDB**: Database setup (if not using Docker for the database).

### **Installation Steps**
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm install
   \`\`\`
3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure the necessary environment variables:
   \`\`\`env
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/mydatabase
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   \`\`\`
4. Run database migrations:
   \`\`\`bash
   npx prisma migrate dev
   \`\`\`
5. Generate Prisma client:
   \`\`\`bash
   npx prisma generate
   \`\`\`

## **Running the Application**
### **With Docker**
1. Build and start the application:
   \`\`\`bash
   docker-compose up --build
   \`\`\`
2. Access the API at `http://localhost:3000`.

### **Without Docker**
1. Start the application:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm run start
   \`\`\`
2. Access the API at `http://localhost:3000`.

## **API Endpoints**
### **Account Manager Service**
- **POST /auth/register**: Register a new user.
- **POST /auth/login**: Login a user and return an authentication token.
- **POST /accounts**: Create a new payment account.
- **GET /accounts**: Retrieve all payment accounts for the authenticated user.
- **GET /accounts/{accountId}/transactions**: Retrieve payment history for a specific account.

### **Payment Manager Service**
- **POST /transactions/send**: Send money from one account to another.
- **POST /transactions/withdraw**: Withdraw money from an account.
- **POST /recurring-payments**: (Optional) Set up a recurring payment.
- **GET /recurring-payments**: (Optional) Retrieve all recurring payments.

## **Database Schema**
The database schema includes tables/models for:
- **User**: Stores user credentials and authentication details.
- **PaymentAccount**: Represents different payment accounts (e.g., credit, debit).
- **Transaction**: Records details of each transaction.
- **PaymentHistory**: (Optional) Stores history of transactions for accounts.

## **Authentication**
Authentication is handled via a third-party provider (e.g., Supertokens or Supabase) or a custom JWT-based implementation. Tokens are required for accessing protected routes.

## **Error Handling**
The application includes error handling for:
- Invalid credentials during login.
- Insufficient funds during transaction processing.
- Invalid account or transaction details.

## **Optional Features**
- **Recurring Payments**: Users can set up recurring payments that are processed automatically at specified intervals.
- **Swagger Documentation**: Accessible at `/docs` to view and interact with the API.

## **Testing**
To run tests, use the following command:
\`\`\`bash
npm run test
\`\`\`
Make sure all endpoints and functionalities are thoroughly tested to ensure the reliability of the application.

## **Future Improvements**
- Add support for more payment methods.
- Enhance the security of transactions with additional verification steps.
- Implement a notification system for transaction alerts.
